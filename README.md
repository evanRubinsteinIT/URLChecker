# URLChecker

# What does it do?
URL Checker is a python script that is made to validate lists of subdomains. It takes a list of subdomains as an input (without the http or https prefix) and it checks to see if it can connect to a page. If it can, the url will be printed to a file called "Checked Subdomains"

# How do I make it work?
Pretty simple actually. All you need to do is clone this respository by opening up your terminal and typing in "git clone https://github.com/evanRubinsteinIT/URLChecker". Alternatively, you can hit the green download button on the top right and then unzip the folder. After that, all you need to do is navigate into the folder, and install the requirements by opening up your terminal and typing in "pip3 install -r requirements.txt". After that, you're ready to rock and roll!

# I think something is wrong with the script, how can I get the issue looked at?
This is a very new project, so I expect that there will be a few glitches/issues. Feel free to click on the issues tab and write what happened. I'll take a look at it and get back to you as soon as I can!
